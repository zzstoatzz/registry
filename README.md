# MCP Registry

The MCP registry provides MCP clients with a list of MCP servers, like an app store for MCP servers.

📖 **[Full documentation](./docs)**

## Development Status

> [!WARNING]  
> The registry is under [active development](#development-status). The registry API spec is unstable and the official MCP registry database may be wiped at any time.

**2025-09-04 update**: We're targeting a 'preview' go-live on 8th September. This may still be unstable and not provide durability guarantees, but is a step towards being more solidified. A general availability (GA) release will follow later.

Often (but not always) ideas flow through this pipeline:

- **[Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication)** - Real-time community discussions
- **[Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions)** - Propose and discuss product/technical requirements
- **[Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/issues)** - Track well-scoped technical work  
- **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/pulls)** - Contribute work towards issues

### Quick start:

#### Pre-requisites

- **Docker**
- **Go 1.24.x** 
- **golangci-lint v2.4.0**

#### Running the server

```bash
# Start full development environment
make dev-compose
```

This starts the registry at [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) with PostgreSQL and seed data. It can be configured with environment variables in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) - see [.env.example](./.env.example) for a reference.

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Local setup without Docker</summary>

**Prerequisites:**
- PostgreSQL running locally
- Go 1.24.x installed

```bash
# Build and run locally
make build
make dev-local
```

The service runs on [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) by default. This can be configured with environment variables in `.env` - see [.env.example](./.env.example) for a reference.

<summary>Alternative: Running a pre-built Docker image</summary>

Pre-built Docker images are automatically published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Run latest stable release
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:latest

# Run latest from main branch (continuous deployment)
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main

# Run specific release version
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:v1.0.0

# Run development build from main branch
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:main-20250906-abc123d
```

**Available tags:** 
- **Releases**: `latest`, `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
- **Continuous**: `main` (latest main branch build)
- **Development**: `main-<date>-<sha>` (specific commit builds)

</details>

#### Publishing a server

To publish a server, we've built a simple CLI. You can use it with:

```bash
# Build the latest CLI
make publisher

# Use it!
./bin/mcp-publisher --help
```

See [the publisher guide](./docs/guides/publishing/publish-server.md) for more details.

#### Other commands

```bash
# Run lint, unit tests and integration tests
make check
```

There are also a few more helpful commands for development. Run `make help` to learn more, or look in [Makefile](./Makefile).

```

### Authentication

Publishing supports multiple authentication methods:
- **GitHub OAuth** - For publishing by logging into GitHub
- **GitHub OIDC** - For publishing from GitHub Actions
- **DNS verification** - For proving ownership of a domain and its subdomains
- **HTTP verification** - For proving ownership of a domain

The registry validates namespace ownership when publishing. E.g. to publish...:
- `io.github.domdomegg/my-cool-mcp` you must login to GitHub as `domdomegg`, or be in a GitHub Action on domdomegg's repos
- `me.adamjones/my-cool-mcp` you must prove ownership of `adamjones.me` via DNS or HTTP challenge
